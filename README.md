# **Sailing-Ships**

## Re-Implementation of a Youtube Series

**This code is not entirely my own** , It was the re-implementation of code when following a youtube series found here **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjKINQigAE4** , the Github for which can be found here: **https://github.com/boardtobits/flocking-algorithm**.

I followed this youtube series to better understand the workflow of creating projects in Unity, and gain an insight into how certain features interact with eachother.

The goal of the youtube series is to implement a 2D flocking algorithm in Unity, as can be here:

## Review

### What I've Learned

Following this series I learned how create scriptable objects as classes in unity and then use these to instantiate an array of these objects all with a common structure.

From there understanding how to create an abstract class and then use this for other classes to inherit from in the from. In this case in the form of behaviours to control the ships movement on the scene.

### Future Work

Future work I want to expand this into 3D and re-implement the boids algorthm in a 3D scene.
